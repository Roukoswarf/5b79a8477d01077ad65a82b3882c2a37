These be x86 only libs, included for windows compile usage.

Keller, as you and I will be developing on Linux, please grab your distro equiv:

Packages:

extra/sdl_image 1.2.12-2
extra/sdl_gfx 2.0.24-1
extra/sdl_ttf 2.0.11-2


I have properly set up the includes for these to only look locally
(for the windows versions) when compiling on windows for jeff/prof.
